# NBA
The file runs through a certain number of simulations of NBA seasons, with a winrate of .8, and determines in how many of them
the warriors never lose 2 games in a row. Then, commented below, there is a simulation that cycles through winrates until the
hypothetical team has over 50% of its seasons without losing 2 games in a row. The numbers were 5.88% probability of never
losing two games in a row with a winrate of 80%, and 50% probability of never losing two games in a row with a winrate of
90.38%.
